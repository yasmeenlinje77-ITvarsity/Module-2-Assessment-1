                            <h3>LIONS</h3>
    <p>ion is a big cat with short, tawny colored fur and white under parts. The long tail ends with
          a black tuft. The lions display sexual dimorphism with males, having their distinctive manes,
          ranging in color from black to blond. They develop their manes at the age of 3 years. Meanwhile, 
          manes of those, living in open areas, are notably fuller. The mane makes lion look much larger than
          it is, helping the animal intimidate the opponent during confrontations with other lions as well the
          Spotted Hyena, which is the animal's primary competitor throughout its range. Young lions have grayish 
          coat, covered with brown markings, which then disappear by the age of 3 months. However, lions in 
          eastern Africa tend to retain these spots on their stomach.</p>
     <p>These animals can be either nocturnal, being active at night, or crepuscular, showing increased activity
           at dusk and before sunset. Lions spend the greater part of the day (up to 20 hours) resting. These 
           animals rest in order to save energy, in the absence of prey or to escape the midday heat. African lions 
           are highly social animals, gathering in groups or prides, which include up to 3 male lions and multiple 
           lionesses with their young. Prides are defended by males, who patrol and mark the territory. However, there's 
           a harsh competition between males for the territory and position in the pride. In a case if another male overcomes 
           the leading male of the pride, he usually kills all cubs, sired by the previous male. Meanwhile, males do not tend 
          to hunt due to their slow speed and eye-catching appearance. Instead, hunting is left to females of the pride, who 
           hunt in groups, cooperating with each other during their hunting trips. The females are excellent hunters: they are
           faster and more agile than males, able to hunt down animals that are much bigger and faster than them.</p>
   <p>Lions are carnivorous animals. These predators primarily hunt on zebras, antelopes, gazelles,
         deer, buffalos, young giraffes, warthogs, wildebeest, young elephants, less frequently â€“ on hares 
         and birds. These animals can also consume flesh of dead animals, occasionally taking away carrion 
         from hyenas and wild dogs.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the lions at pen E27, at the Northern Frontier.</p>
