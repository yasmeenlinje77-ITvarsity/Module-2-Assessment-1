                            <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
    <p>The gorilla is a massive primate species with a short muzzle, proportionately
          large hands and the projecting brow ridge. They lack tails, having small ears and eyes,
          large nostrils and jet black skin. They have quite a large thumb and nails on all digits. 
          They have large muscles on their jaws as well as strong, broad teeth. The whole body, with
          the exception of the face, ears, hands, and feet, is covered with dark tough fur. The fur of
         gorillas is brown to grey in color. Older male gorillas are called "silverbacks" due 
          to the hair on their back and rump, which is originally grey, loosing with age.</p>
                             
     <p>These primates are highly social animals, gathering in groups of 5-15 individuals. 
           A group usually consists of females with their young and one dominant male. They get
           around by walking on their four limbs. Western gorillas are active by day. They construct 
           day and night nests where they rest and sleep. Their nests are soft cushions, built on the
           ground or in trees, out of branches and leaves. Lightweight gorillas tend to hang out of tree 
           branches, using their arms. Normally, these animals are quite peaceful, friendly and shy. However, 
           they emit loud growling sounds and can be extremely dangerous, when threatened or attacked. In order 
          to scare away intruders or demonstrate their strength, male gorillas stand straight, beating their 
           chests with their fists. Nevertheless, they don't tend to hit the opponent, instead preferring to retreat
           and then charge again.</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gorillas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
