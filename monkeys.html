                            <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
    <p>Monkeys are a large and diverse mammal group that includes 
          most primates. Humans, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and other 
          apes share an ancestor with monkeys but belong to a separate group
          of primates that diverged from monkeys millions of years ago. Monkeys
          are typically smaller than apes and usually have tails, which apes lack.
          The monkey group doesn't include lemurs, which are another branch of the 
          primate family tree and live in Madagascar.

There are a variety of monkeys, spread across the world, with very different lifestyles. 
          They come in many shapes, sizes and colors, but they are all intelligent and social creatures..</p>
     <p>Monkeys are very social animals, living in groups of 20 - 50 animals. 
           As in most Old World monkeys, these groups have stable and temporary members.
           The core of each group is made up of multiple families, which in turn consist 
           of closely related mature females with their young. When reaching maturity, young 
           males leave to join another group, whereas females continue living with their natal group. 
           When trying to join a new group, these young males often face aggression from its members.
           Hence, they prefer associating with peers or their maternal brothers. Males often move between
           groups several times throughout their lives. Although territorial species, the Green monkeys
           don't tend engage in serious confrontations. These primates are diurnal creatures. Activity
           peaks occur in the early morning and late afternoon. The Green monkeys are generally terrestrial, 
           but may occasionally sleep in trees. Additionally, they are known to find refuge in trees when threatened..</p>
   <p>As omnivorous animals, the Green monkeys feed upon food of both plant and animal origin.
         They generally consume fruits, flowers, seeds, seedpods, leaves, grasses and roots, 
         supplementing this diet with insects, small reptiles as well as birds and their eggs. 
         These primates are also known to favor invertebrates and particularly, crabs.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the monkeys at pen E28, at the Monkey Trail.</p>
