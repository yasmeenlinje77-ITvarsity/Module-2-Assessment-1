                            <h3>PANDAS</h3>
    <p>The panda is a bear of medium to large size with a large head, small eyes, long muzzle,
          large nose, and short tail. It has a very good sense of smell. It has large jaws with strong muscles,
          and together with its flat molars, is able to crush bamboo leaves and stems. Its thick fur is creamy-white
          with big black patches on shoulders, ears, and nose, with distinctive black patches around its eyes. An extension 
          of its wrist bone, which serves as a thumb, enables them to grip bamboo stems.</p>
     <p>Giant pandas are terrestrial animals although they are able to climb and take shelter in hollow trees or rock crevices,
           but do not establish permanent dens. For this reason, pandas do not hibernate. They are solitary, occupying a territory 
           which they mark with secretions from their scent glands and by scratch marks on trees. They spend 12 to 15 hours a day 
           chewing bamboo while sitting down with their front paws holding onto the plants. Giant pandas are crepuscular, being 
           active twice a day, at dawn and dusk. They eat as much as 9 to 14 kg (20 to 30 lb) of bamboo shoots a day and will travel
           between different habitats if they need to, so they can get the nutrients that they need and to balance their diet for reproduction. 
           Pandas communicate through vocalization and can swim.</p>
                             <p>Pandas are herbivores (folivores) and in the wild, they eat 99 percent bamboo. They may also eat meat, fish, 
                                   and eggs when available.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find Pandas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
