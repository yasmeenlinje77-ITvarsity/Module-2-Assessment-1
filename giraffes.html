                            <h3>Girrafes</h3>
    <p>Giraffes are the world’s tallest living animals, easily identified due to their exclusively long neck.
          The legs of giraffes are long and solid. The hind legs are shorter than the front legs. The eyes are quite large,
          ears are medium-sized and the muzzle is long. The short mane stands upright. The tail is long and thin with a dark 
          tassel of hair at the tip. Giraffes have short and sandy colored coat. They have pelage markings of different shape,
          colored various shades of brown. This animal has bony horns or ossicones, placed on the top of its head. Normally, 
          horns of giraffes are medium-sized in both males and females. Male giraffes can sometimes grow another pair of horns
          behind the first pair. Females are identified by thin and tufted ossicones while males usually have thick horns with the hair,
          smoothed due to sparring.</p>
     <p>Giraffes are herbivorous (folivorous) with their diet, mainly consisting of acacia trees. Being browsers, these animals will also 
           consume flowers, fruits, buds, and wild apricots. In addition, they love eating seeds and fresh grass after the rain. They rarely 
           drink, obtaining about 70% of the required moisture from food.</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
