                            <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
    <p>Giraffes are the worldâ€™s tallest living animals, easily identified due to their exclusively long neck.
          The legs of giraffes are long and solid. The hind legs are shorter than the front legs. The eyes are quite large,
          ears are medium-sized and the muzzle is long. The short mane stands upright. The tail is long and thin with a dark 
          tassel of hair at the tip. Giraffes have short and sandy colored coat. They have pelage markings of different shape,
          colored various shades of brown. This animal has bony horns or ossicones, placed on the top of its head. Normally, 
          horns of giraffes are medium-sized in both males and females. Male giraffes can sometimes grow another pair of horns
          behind the first pair. Females are identified by thin and tufted ossicones while males usually have thick horns with the hair,
          smoothed due to sparring.</p>
                             <p>Due to their large size, these animals spend a lot of time eating, usually in the mornings and evenings. 
                                   They rest standing up during the night. In the heat of the day, they will rest in shady areas, regurgitating 
                                   the food and then ingesting it again. Female giraffes and their young gather into small herds, keeping constantly 
                                   together, in order to protect the calves from predators. Males prefer leading solitary lives, traveling long distances
                                   to find a fertile female. When two rival males encounter each other, they start "necking" - bumping heads and interlocking 
                                   the necks to defend their mating rights and set up a dominance hierarchy. The winner of the encounter will be allowed to mate with local females.</p>
     <p>Giraffes are herbivorous (folivorous) with their diet, mainly consisting of acacia trees. Being browsers, these animals will also 
           consume flowers, fruits, buds, and wild apricots. In addition, they love eating seeds and fresh grass after the rain. They rarely 
           drink, obtaining about 70% of the required moisture from food.</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the giraffes at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
