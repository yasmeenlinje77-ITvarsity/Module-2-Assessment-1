                            <h3>KOALAS</h3>
    <p>Koalas are charming marsupial with a thick-set body, small eyes, and large ears. 
          The wool-like coat of the animal is thick but soft, colored with ash-grey. The densely 
          packed fur on the bottom serves as a cushion, allowing koalas to sit upon rough tree branches.
          The underparts as well as the tips of hairs on their ears are white. In the center of their chest, 
          adult male koalas have the identifying brown-colored "scent gland". One of the key characteristics
          of this animal is a very strong sense of smell, which helps them distinguish between poisonous and 
          eatable leaves. They have large sharp claws on their long limbs, which help them in climbing trees,
          as well as 5 digits, including opposable thumbs, allowing them to grip tree branches and food.</p>
     <p>Koalas are asocial animals, congregating only during the breeding season. They usually form large,
           loosely organized groups in areas with abundant suitable trees, with a single individual per tree.
           During the rest of the year, koalas tend to live solitarily, showing very little social behavior.
           They are arboreal animals, dwelling in trees. Koalas are exceptionally good climbers. Meanwhile,
           when on the ground, they are very slow walkers. During the daytime hours, these nocturnal animals usually 
           sleep in the fork of eucalyptus trees. Normally, koalas are quiet animals. However, when threatened or alarmed,
           they typically give out a call, reminding cry of a human baby, and accompanying it by shaking. In addition, 
           during the breeding season, males of this species begin to emit bellowing calls. Koalas also scent-mark their
           trees, which is a form of communication.</p>
   <p>Koalas are herbivorous (folivorous) animals, feeding primarily upon the leaves of the eucalyptus tree. Meanwhile,
         they consume leaves of 30 various species of the eucalyptus tree. In addition, they supplement their usual diet
         with melaleuca, foliage from leptospermum, and acacias.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the koalas at pen E26, right opposite the giraffes.</p>
