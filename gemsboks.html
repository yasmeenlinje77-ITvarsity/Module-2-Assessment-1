                            <h3>GEMSBOKS</h3>
    <p>The gemsbok is a large antelope native to Southern Africa. 
       It is light brownish-grey to tan in color, with lighter patches toward the bottom rear of the rump. 
          Its tail is long and black in color. A blackish stripe extends from the chin down the lower edge of the neck, 
          through the juncture of the shoulder and leg along the lower flank of each side to the blackish section of the rear leg.
          The gemsbok has a muscular neck and shoulders, and its legs have white 'socks' with a black patch on the front of both the front legs and both
          genders have long, straight horns.</p>
     <p>Gemsbok are gregarious and live in herds of about 10-40 animals.
           These herds consist of a dominant male, a few non-dominant males, and females.
           Gemsbok are generally grazers but change to browsing during the dry season or when the grass
           is sparse and may dig up to a meter deep to find roots and tubers. They usually feed early in the 
           morning and late afternoon to avoid midday heat and may sometimes be active on moonlit nights. These are 
           mainly desert-dwelling antelopes and they do not depend on drinking water to supply their physiological needs. 
           Gemsbok are excellent runners and when threatened they can reach speeds of up to 60 km/h (37 mph).</p>
                             <p>Gemsbok are herbivores (graminivores, folivores). They consume grasses, thorny shrubs, roots,
                                   tubers, and supplement their water intake by eating wild tsama melons and cucumbers.</p>
                             <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gemsboks at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
