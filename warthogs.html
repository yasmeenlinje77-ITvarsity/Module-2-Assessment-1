                            <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
    <p>Warthogs are medium-sized wild members of the pig family. Warthogs are identifiable by 
          the two pairs of tusks protruding from the mouth and curving upwards. The tusks are 
          not used for digging but are used for combat with other hogs, and in defense against predators. 
          Warthogs have a large head, with a mane down the spine to the middle of the back. Their body is
          covered with sparse hair and is usually black or brown in color. Tails are long and end with a tuft of hair.
          Females in this species are typically a bit smaller and lighter in weight than males.</p>
     <p>Common warthogs are social animals and live in groups called sounders. Females live in sounders with their young 
           and with other females. Females tend to stay in their natal groups, while males leave, but stay within the home range.
           Subadult males associate in bachelor groups but live alone when they become adults. Adult males only join sounders during 
           the breeding season. Common warthogs are not territorial but instead occupy a home range. They have two facial glands: the tusk
           gland and the sebaceous gland. They mark sleeping and feeding areas and waterholes. Common warthogs use tusk marking for courtship,
           for antagonistic behaviors, and to establish status. These animals are the only pig species that has adapted to grazing in savanna habitats. 
           They are powerful diggers and use both their snouts and feet. Whilst feeding, they often bend their front feet backward and move around on the wrists.
           Although they can dig their own burrows, they usually occupy abandoned burrows of other animals. When temperatures are hight Common warthogs enjoy 
           wallowing in mud in order to cool themselves and will huddle together to get warm when the temperatures get low. Although capable of fighting,
           the Common warthog's primary defense is to flee by means of fast sprinting. However, if a female has any piglets, she will defend them very 
           aggressively.</p>
   <p>Warthogs are omnivorous but also scavengers. They feed on grasses, roots, berries, and other fruits,
         bark, fungi, insects, eggs, and carrion.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the warthogs at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
